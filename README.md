# Warming Fireplace Site

This project is a made-up site for those interested in the folklore and stories around fireplaces, built using HTML and CSS. It was inspired by a challenge from the Scrimba platform by learning how to build a "Space Exploration Site".

## Key Learnings from this:

- Buttons don't inherit styles because each browser has its own specific way of styling the actual elements - font-families for example
- More fonts on the page means more data to download - limit to 2 - 3 font-families per page
- Span tag is an inline element
- Div tag is display block
- **background-size: cover;**: the image will fill the element while maintaining its aspect ratio
- CTA - Call to Action: a prompt on a website that asks users to perform a specific action like signing up for a newsletter, downloading a demo, or buying a product
- DOM - Document Object Model
- Class can be reused
- ID is Unique and is to be used once
- **text-shadow: horizontal vertical color;** or **text-shadow: horizontal vertical blur color;** eg: **text-shadow: 5px 2px 1px #fff**
- **border-image: fill 1 inear-gradient(purple, blue);**: Add an overlay to a background-image with one line of CSS. Kevin Powell has a great video for this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwnZU6mWJkk&t=10s&ab_channel=KevinPowell
- HTML lang attribute sets the language of the content in the HTML page: html lang="en" for English

### Note on Replaced Elements:

Replaced elements are specific HTML elements whose content is not directly defined within the HTML document itself. Instead, their content is sourced from external files or resources. This allows for the inclusion of various media types, such as images, videos, or audio files. The browser renders these elements based on the information provided by the external source, rather than the HTML markup.
